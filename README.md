# Numerical Methods Lab

This repository includes the lab worksheets and assignments for the Numerical Methods Lab course at [Independent University, Bangladesh](http://iub.edu.bd/). [Amin Ahsan Ali](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/faculties/53) will teach the course during the Autumn 2022 semester. This course will teach students computational methodologies for dealing with problems in linear algebra, nonlinear equations, optimization, interpolation and approximation, numerical integration, and differential equations. The student will learn to use numerical approaches to solve engineering and scientific problems. Additionally, the course seeks to teach students how to incorporate numerical approaches into computer applications. This course will offer a basic foundation in numerical approaches to aid ongoing study in machine learning, data science, and other related topics.

# Course Objectives

- Learn to use python and numpy to solve numerical problems.
- Use python to solve problems like regression, interpolation, clustering and classification.
- Write efficient and well-documented code.
- Learn to present results in a clear and informative manner.

# Course Outline

- ## Introduction to Python and Numpy:
  In lab 1, we will learn the basics of python and numpy. We will learn how to use python decare variables, use loops, and write functions. We will also learn how to use numpy to create arrays and perform basic operations on them. We will also learn how to use matplotlib to plot graphs and use pillow to read and write images.

# Prerequisites

Following are the prerequisites for this course:

- [MAT 104 : Calculus and Analytical Geometry](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/courses/27)
- [MAT 212 : Probability & Statistics for Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/courses/29)
- [CEN 306 + Lab : Algorithms](http://www.cse.iub.edu.bd/courses/103)

# Evaluation

The evaluation of the course will be based on programming assignments and lab exams. Every two weeks, there will be assignments that will require you to solve problems using python and numpy. Unless explicitly mentioned, all assignments must be completed individually. This lab will contribute 25% of the grade for the "Numerical Methods" course.

# Environment Setup

We will use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for this course. Google Colab is a free cloud service that allows us to run python code in the cloud. We can use it to run python code without installing anything on our computer. We can also use it to run python code on a GPU. We will use Google Colab for all the labs and assignments in this course.
